Website displaying information about native birds. Previously this website was deployed using Heroku, which has support for database connectivity. When this was the case there was a MongoDB database running in the back which enabled the user to update bird information and add new birds. However, MongoDB has deactivated my node due to prolonged inactivity. So a static version of the website is deployed using GitHub pages to the address: https://calteape.github.io/BirdWebsite/.

There is a known bug, where the bird tiles are not repacked tightly after applying a filter, so the panel has large gaps in it.
